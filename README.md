# Palindrome JS

Palindrome JS is an MVCVM framework … that's right, Model, View, Controller, ViewModel. Right now it's more concept than code, so the fact that there may also be Mediators, ViewControllers, a Router, Routes, Events, Collections, Adapters, Templates, and maybe even some kind Renderer doesn't bother me and it shouldn't bother you. I'll deal with whether or not the framework has palindrometric component initials when there's actual code in here.
