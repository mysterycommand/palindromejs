# [Palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) JS

Palindrome JS is an MVCVM framework … that's right, Model, View, Controller, ViewModel. Right now it's more concept than code, so the fact that there may also be Mediators, ViewControllers, a Router, Routes, Events, Collections, Adapters, Templates, and maybe even some kind Renderer doesn't bother me and it shouldn't bother you. I'll deal with whether or not the framework has palindrometric component initials when there's actual code in here.

## Problem No. 1: Inheritance

There are a lot of ways to do inheritance in JavaScript, but all of the good articles I can find seem really old:

* Dean Edwards' [Base](http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/03/base/) (March 2006)
* Alex Arnell's [Prototype: Inheritance Madness](http://alternateidea.com/blog/articles/2006/05/23/prototype-inheritance-madness) (October 2007)
* John Resig's [Simple JavaScript Inheritance](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/) (March 2008)
